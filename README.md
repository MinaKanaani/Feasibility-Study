# Feasibility-Study
In this project, my teammates and I conducted a comprehensive feasibility study project on Ball Bearing production plant. This project included three main areas of analysis:
Technical Analysis: including careful analysis of the product and its exact applications, similar products and replacements, life cycle assessment, required technology for production
Market Analysis: including careful study of the market, current demand & supply, imports & exports, market gap, and estimation of future demand
Financial and Economic Analysis: including required capital estimation, cost analysis, pricing, finding the breakeven point, and balance sheet and income statement analysis
